# Unreal Geometry Map Ported! 
The **Unreal Geometry Map** has been ported to modern versions of **Minecraft Java Edition** by **ilman01**!  

- **No mods required!** This version is entirely powered by **command blocks**, so no extra mods are needed.  
- **Works somewhat well on recent Java Edition versions**, though **some flickering may occur when teleporting**.
- **Using the Sodium mod fixes this flickering issue, making teleportation seamless!**
- **Fully retains the Non-Euclidean experience**, allowing impossible spaces to exist using only vanilla Minecraft mechanics.  

### **Bedrock Edition is NOT supported**  
This port **does not work on Bedrock Edition** due to:
- **Command parity issues** - some commands work differently in Bedrock.  
- **Unsmooth teleportation** - Java already has some flickering, but on Bedrock, teleportation is even less seamless.  

### **Why Did ilman01 Port This?**  
ilman01 ported this map as a passion project, inspired by their childhood obsession with the original **Unreal Geometry Map**. Wanting to relive the experience and make it accessible to modern **Minecraft Java Edition** players, they recreated the map using command blocks, removing the need for mods. While teleportation flickering exists in vanilla, **using the Sodium mod eliminates this issue**, making the experience much smoother!  

### **Access the Ported Version**  
The ported version of the **Unreal Geometry Map** is available in this repository.  
Make sure to check the repo files to download and play the map!  

For the best experience, play this port on **Minecraft Java Edition** version **1.20.1** and above with **Sodium**!
